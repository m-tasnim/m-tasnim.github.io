Hey there, I'm Mayesha! I'm a PhD student at the [Civic AI Lab](https://www.civic-ai.nl/) and a member of the [Socially Intelligent Artifical Systems](https://www.sias-uva.nl/) (SIAS) group in University of Amsterdam. I'm currently researching the application of [Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://www.busoniu.net/files/papers/marl_chapter_springer.pdf) in [Automated Mechanism Design](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/amd_overview.cp03.pdf). I'm also interested in social choice theory, particularly in the context of resource allocation and in the presence of strategic agents. Finally, I am interested in the application of these methods in making education more accessible and equitable.

I was born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My hometown has many problems but none perhaps so cruel as the inequality of opportunity â€” particularly when it comes to education. I love Computer Science because of the opportunities it creates in making knowledge democratic and accessible. I have dedicated my academic life to learn about technologies that can make education accessible for everyone, particularly marginalized communities.
