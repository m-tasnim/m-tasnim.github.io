Hey there, I'm Mayesha! I'm a PhD student at the [Civic AI Lab](https://www.civic-ai.nl/) and a part of the [Socially Intelligent Artifical Systems](https://www.sias-uva.nl/) (SIAS) group in University of Amsterdam.  
I like to learn about technologies that bridge social gaps and create opportunities. 
My research interests include Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning and Automated Mechanisn Design. 

I was born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh - the most densely populated city in the world. The city has many problems but none perhaps so cruel as the inequality of opportunity - particularly when it comes to education. 
I love Computer Science because of the opportunities it creates in making knowledge democratic and accessible. I have dedicated my academic life to learn about technologies that can make education accessible for everyone, particularly marginalized communities.
