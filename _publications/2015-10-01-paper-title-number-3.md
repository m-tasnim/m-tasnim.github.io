collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-minte
excerpt: 'Data Scientist is one of the most sought-after jobs of this decade. In order to analyze the job market in this domain, interested institutions have to integrate numerous job advertising coming from heterogeneous Web sources eg, job portals, company websites, professional community platforms such as StackOverflow, GitHub, etc. In this demo, we show the application of the RDF Molecule-Based Integration Framework MINTE+ in the domain-specific application of job market analysis. The use of RDF molecules for knowledge representation is a core element of the framework gives MINTE+ enough flexibility to integrate job advertising from different web resources and countries. Attendees will observe how exploration and analysis of the data science job market in Europe can be facilitated by synthesizing at query time a consolidated knowledge graph of job advertising.'
